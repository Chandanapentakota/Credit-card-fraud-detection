# Credit-card-fraud-detection

Before knowing the credit card fraud detection,we have to know the purpose of credit card and how it works.
 A credit card is a physical payment card that allows us to get credit from a financial institution.we should repay the borrowed amount with an interest each month according to the billing cycle.

 Coming to our project ,there will be dataset where both the fraudlent transactions and correct transactions is mixed in that dataset.Now,we have to detect the fraudlent transactions from the dataset by using different machine learning algorithms.
